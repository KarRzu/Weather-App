 <b>Requirement Analysis and Planning</b>
 - Define Key Features:
Current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.)
Weather forecasts (hourly, daily, weekly)
Weather alerts and notifications
Location-based services (automatic location detection and manual location entry)

-  API Integration
API Key Management: Securely store and manage API keys.
Data Fetching and Parsing: Fetch weather data from the API and parse it into a usable format.
Error Handling: Manage API call failures and data inconsistencies gracefully.



<b>:blue_book: Learning</b>

- When I started creating weather app, I learning a lot of things. For exapmle, how created sign up
 form and sign in form, using Firebase.


- User interface (UI) and user experience (UX).
Tool design (Sketch, Figma): Designing intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces.
UX Principles: Understanding the principles of good UX to ensure an enjoyable and effective application experience.

-  API Integration
RESTful APIs: Retrieve data from external services such as OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI.
JSON/XML Parsing: Processing weather data returned by APIs.


<b>:seedling: Improvements</b>

Weather App will ultimately have a couple of thing yet . Here are of the examples:

-  Weather Map display with data weather
- Login with Google
-  Possibility change language
-  Option added countries to favourite list
